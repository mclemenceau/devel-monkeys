# Devel Monkeys üêµ

## Introduction
**Devel Monkeys** is a collection of simple scripts designed to ease development operations like viewing diff files or build log.
I've used this mostly while contributing to Ubuntu but I don't see why it can't used elsewhere.

Currently, this repository includes:
- ![Color Diff Icon](icons/color-diff-icon-16x16.png) **[Color Diff Viewer (Tampermonkey Script)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mclemenceau/devel-monkeys/main/scripts/color-diff.user.js)**: Enhances `.diff`, `.diff.gz` and `.patch` files viewed in Chrome/Firefox by adding syntax highlighting (green for additions, red for deletions, orange for headers).

This project is intended to grow with more scripts relevant to helping development operations.
